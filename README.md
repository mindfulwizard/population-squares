#My solution to the following challenge:

Use the API to dynamically get the list of countries in the world using Javascript and Ajax. Of the countries tied for the shortest name, display the 5 with the largest populations, each as a blue square box with the country name. When the user clicks on any country's box, the country's square should become red, and you should query the API using Ajax to retrieve the country's overall, male, and female, population of current (i.e. as of 2016) 18 year olds. These three populations should be added and displayed with the country's display box.
